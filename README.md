# Pok3r Keybinds

## Layer 2 - Windows

## Layer 3 -> Mac
The first thing I did is switch `CapsLock` and `L_Ctrl` in Mac itself. This is because when I use the laptop keyboard, I want this configuration to stay the same.

### [Move Fn to L_Ctrl](https://github.com/davidjenni/pok3r-layouts#Move_FN)
	
* Unplug keyboard
* DIP switch 4 to ON
* Plugin keyboard again, then press `Fn` then: `L_Ctrl` then: `PN` then: `PN` (to leave it in its original location)
* DIP switch 4 back to OFF (no need to unplug)

### Fn + y -> Open new tab and go to youtube.com

* `Fn + R_Ctrl` to enter programming mode
* `Fn + y` to select target keys
* `Fn + T` to add 15ms delay
* `Cmd + T + youtube.com + Enter` as the macro
* `Pn` to set the macro
* `Fn + R_Ctrl` to exit programming mode

### Fn + r -> Open new tab and go to reddit.com

* Same as above

### Fn + x -> Open Xcode using Alred

* `Fn + R_Ctrl`
* `Fn + x`
* Alred shortcut (I use Cmd + Cmd)
* `Fn + t` 15ms delay
* xcode
* `Fn + g` to add 0.1ms delay
* `Enter`
* `Pn`
* `Fn + R_Ctrl`

### Fn + p -> Screenshot window and copy to clipboard

* `Fn + R_Ctrl`
* `Fn + p`
* `Cmd + Shift + L_Ctrl + 4` - mac shortcut for screenshot + copy to clipboard
* `Fn + t` to add 15ms delay
* `Space` for window mode
* `Pn`
* `Fn + R_Ctrl`

### Fn + p -> Screenshot (select area) and copy to clipboard

* `Fn + R_Ctrl`
* `Fn + o`
* `Cmd + Shift + L_Ctrl + 4` - mac shortcut for screenshot + copy to clipboard
* `Pn`
* `Fn + R_Ctrl`


### Fn + \ -> Show/Hide Navigator + Debug Area + Utilities in Xcode

* `Fn + R_Ctrl`
* `Fn + \`
* `Cmd + 0` to toggle navigator
* `Fn + t` to add 15ms delay
* `Alt + Cmd + 0` to toggle utilities (I switched the order of Alt and Cmd because Cmd first was trigering Alfred
* `Fn + t` to add 15ms delay
* `Cmd + Shift + y` to toggle debug area
* `Pn`
* `Fn + R_Ctrl`

### R_Shift to L_Shift (So that R_Shift + Esc = ~)

* `Fn + R_Ctrl`
* `R_Shift`
* `L_Shift`
* `Pn`
* `Fn + R_Ctrl`

### Default useful keybinds

* `Fn + S/D/F` - Volume decrease / increase / rmute
* `Fn + Q/W/E` - Song previous / (play/pause) / next
* `Fn + I/J/K/L` - Arrow keys up/left/down/right
* `Fn + [` and `Fn + ]` - Screen brightness modifiers
* `Win + R_alt + Space` to activate permanent arrow keys (R_shift, Fn, Pn, R_Ctrl)
